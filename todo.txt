- just added some more disease states and got the tagline working
- diseases array kinda ends, might have a misplaced comma
- tagline needs some more randomization thrown in, it's always taking the [1] entry in the arrays
- tagline also needs particles, I am not sure vowelsense() works inside the function
- chemical name seems to only have one method, needs more


- precious few notes on dev, ought to keep up with that... anyway, lots of filler text, still needs to be able to indicate and so on

- eventually would like to change the pills graphic, make SVGs and have random pills animated to fall in and cascade down, there's probably a JS library for the physics of that

NEXT STEPS:
 - Add switches for the brand name generation... it currently only does one method
 - Add switches for the chemical name genereation...
 - Add switches for the tagline genereation...

 - Add a physics library like planck.js or matter.js and animate falling pills

- the physics.js example, Google Gravity, does basically what I am after here: http://wellcaffeinated.net/PhysicsJS/examples/google-gravity.html
