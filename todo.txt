- KNOWN ISSUES: pills freeze at a consistent spot roughly 6000px from top of page (EDIT: found out why, it's line 64 in jquery.throwable). Solution: set a maximum of 100 of each criteria. 
- FIX: Made edits to jquery.throwable.js, should probably fork it if it's on GH

- It's not mobile responsive at all -- javascript scale fix here: https://css-tricks.com/scaled-proportional-blocks-with-css-and-javascript/ 
- Not sure how to solve for the pills at the top on smaller screens, they're just right at 1920 px width... there are not containers around them and throwable makes them absolute positioned within the parent object
- Needs a control panel to refresh and change lengths, right now there is none CHECK
- Still with that text update, I didn't really get far earlier


May 25 update
- pills don't really teleport, I don't know what to do except just start with a handful and leave them there
- limited object issue dealt with by adding fewer pills to the scene and starting with a grid at 30-60% width; this works fine on my own desktop, unknown about other sizes (prob not good)
- multicolor added
- thinking now about refining text a little, especially adverse/contra which are basically empty, safetyipsum had more going on here
- also thinking about overhauling the PHP basis and making it able to replace text without refresh, using JS (unknown how this would affect footer placement and throwable area)


May 19
- figure out how to make sloped wall, I'm not sure box2d can actually do this -- IT CANNOT
- figure out how to teleport pills to top, or just allow them to stay on screen 
issue: limited objects
- it blows up on the 25th - 30th pill creation, we get "pair is undefined" in throwable line 167 (IF USING UPDATED BOX2D CODE)
- if using original Box2d, it gives "i is undefined" in.... somewhere in the minified version (.. just noticed I was using var i in pharmageddon.js... wonder if that's it)
- this happens even if objects are cleared. BTW, clearing using .remove() stops all elements entirely.  .detach() works better, but then we have this problem.
- throwable.js could be rewritten to depend on planck.js instead of Box2d (last updated one month ago, rather than seven years) but that's 600+ lines of code.
- resizing the window messes up placement of absolute objects, oh well

- all I've been doing is the javascript, I'm not even working on the text anymore
- kind of want to rewrite the, uh, most of the text stuff to use javascript
- it would be neat to change the text without refreshing the page





May 7th 2018
 - add pills (classes in CSS already, capsule/square di + round/oval mono, do the vice versas next) CHECK
 - put pills in header using CSS positioning, replace header image with many many divs
 - activate throwable JS on pills so they fall at load CHECK
 - use "wall" class to cover main content
 - use JS to destroy pills that fall out of frame and create new pills at top
 - use CSS filter: blur(px) and transitions to make them blur really nicely as they vanish, maybe some vanish early, maybe they can be dragged to a vanish zone
 - I'm thinking some kind of measure of distance from the top, at 50% they begin to blur, by 80% they're blurred to around 7px and then they lose opacity... the throwables have a "top" attribute, so maybe the JS gets height of the whole document and calcs the distance divided by that... 



Dec 6th 2017

- just added some more disease states and got the tagline working
- diseases array kinda ends, might have a misplaced comma
- tagline needs some more randomization thrown in, it's always taking the [1] entry in the arrays
- tagline also needs particles, I am not sure vowelsense() works inside the function
- chemical name seems to only have one method, needs more


- precious few notes on dev, ought to keep up with that... anyway, lots of filler text, still needs to be able to indicate and so on

- eventually would like to change the pills graphic, make SVGs and have random pills animated to fall in and cascade down, there's probably a JS library for the physics of that

NEXT STEPS:
 - Add switches for the brand name generation... it currently only does one method
 - Add switches for the chemical name genereation...
 - Add switches for the tagline genereation...

 - Add a physics library like planck.js or matter.js and animate falling pills

- the physics.js example, Google Gravity, does basically what I am after here: http://wellcaffeinated.net/PhysicsJS/examples/google-gravity.html
